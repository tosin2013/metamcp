# Contributing to MetaMCP

We welcome contributions to MetaMCP! This guide will help you get started.

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/metatool-ai/metamcp.git
   cd metamcp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Set up environment:
   ```bash
   cp example.env .env
   ```

4. Start development:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
### **üê≥ Docker Development with Hot Reload**

For development with Docker that includes hot reloading for both frontend and backend:

```bash
# Start development environment with hot reload
pnpm run dev:docker

# Stop development environment
pnpm run dev:docker:down

# Clean up development environment (removes volumes)
pnpm run dev:docker:clean
```

**Features:**
- üîÑ **Hot Reload**: Both frontend (Next.js) and backend (Express) automatically reload on code changes
- üê≥ **Containerized**: Full development environment in Docker with PostgreSQL
- üìä **Ports**: Frontend on 12008, Backend on 12009, PostgreSQL on 9433
- üõ†Ô∏è **Development Tools**: Includes all necessary development dependencies and tools

**Requirements:**
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- `.env` file configured (copy from `example.env`)

**Note:** The first run may take longer as it builds the development image. Subsequent runs will be faster.

## OpenID Connect (OIDC) Provider Setup

MetaMCP supports OpenID Connect authentication for enterprise SSO integration. This is optional and can be configured alongside the default email/password authentication.

### Configuration

To enable OIDC authentication, add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

#### Required Variables
```bash
OIDC_CLIENT_ID=your-oidc-client-id
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=your-oidc-client-secret
OIDC_DISCOVERY_URL=https://your-provider.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

For now full endpoints discovery is not supported, so you'll need to provide the authorization endpoint:
```bash
OIDC_AUTHORIZATION_URL=https://your-provider.com/auth/authorize
```

#### Optional Configuration
```bash
OIDC_PROVIDER_ID=oidc                    # Default: "oidc"
OIDC_SCOPES=openid email profile         # Default: "openid email profile"
OIDC_PKCE=true                          # Default: true (recommended for security)
```

### Usage

Once configured, users will see a "Login with OIDC" button on the login page. The authentication flow follows the OpenID Connect Authorization Code flow with PKCE for enhanced security.

### Security Considerations

- PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) is enabled by default for enhanced security
- The redirect URI is automatically configured as `${APP_URL}/api/auth/oauth2/callback/oidc`
- Ensure your OIDC provider is configured to allow this redirect URI

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **Invalid Redirect URI**: Ensure your OIDC provider allows `${APP_URL}/api/auth/oauth2/callback/oidc`
2. **Scope Issues**: Some providers require specific scopes beyond the default `openid email profile`
3. **User Creation**: Users are automatically created on first login. Ensure your provider returns email and name claims

**Debug Mode:**

Enable debug logging by setting the auth logger level in `apps/backend/src/auth.ts` to see detailed OIDC flow information.
